/*
The landscape is the backbone of any world.
It's defines the valleys and mountains, that in turn influence weather, vegetation, etc.

For now it will be just perlin noise.
The settings for the noise are what defines the terrain.

I may later add other fancy algorithm to improve the terrain but for now I am too lazy.
